            <p>A lot of the time, the work I do is for my employer (current or previous) &amp; as such it is private or data sensitive. While I could recreate public versions to show, often that would require a lot of overhead infrastructure or resources I don't have.</p>
            <p>Below are some of my works that I have been able to show publicly. Generally odds &amp; ends I do for myself or things I do as freelance work.</p>
