# johnweland.github.io

This is a rebuild of my portfolio site. This way built following some design courses from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) with his [modern portfolio design](https://github.com/bradtraversy/modern_portfolio). I have since extended and built out to be my own.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
node (npm)
```

### Installing

You will need to install mustache-js this is included in the package.json so a simple init will get it up and running.

```
npm init
```

Sass Compiling

```
npm sass -w {sass directory} -o {path/to/css}
```

I recommend using VS Code's live reload for viewing.

## TODO

Add templating for the work.html projects.
Add actual data.
