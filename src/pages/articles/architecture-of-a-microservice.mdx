It is not uncommon these days to have a potential employer put your skills to the test with a code challenge. Typically, in my experience, this is a smaller task or set of tasks and they expect you do perform live over the course of a few minutes to an hour.

This was the first time I had-- had a code challenge that was not live and where the expected turnaround was approximately a week or development time.

## The Project Description

> The goal of this exercise is to iterate on the development and deployment of a “cloud native” service in AWS that can be invoked to check a set of IP address lists for every single attempted phone call placed on our network, as part of a larger fraud detection system.If the IP address is listed in any sources, then they should be returned.
> The service will retrieve and automatically update from https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets without any manual intervention.
>
> Deliverables should include everything needed to deploy(and maintain) the service in a > production AWS account.
> Bonus points for high availability deployments, benchmarks, and telemetry.
> Code should be developed in Typescript or Java, and only make the assumption all developers run a macOS development environment.
> You can create an AWS account and use the free tier.However, if for some reason you need an account please let us know.
>
> There is no right or wrong deliverable, and no magic “correct” solution we are looking for.We > are trying to simulate our real remote work development environment, so you can get an idea of > how we work, and we can get the same from you.
>
> We are interested in how you communicate remotely, solicit feedback, drive discussion, think about problems, handle areas you don’t know well, and how you think about / work through design decisions.
>
> - The skills we are assessing in this process are:
> - Async Communication
> - Research / Design
> - Coding
> - Autonomy / Ownership
> - Expectation Management
> - Customer / Product Focus
> - Attention To Detail
>
> Please track the effort you invest in this and keep us updated.We know this is not full time, and a significant hurdle to ask of many people - so it is useful to know how much time you have spent on it.We would expect this to take a few days of wall - clock time(ideally no more than a week), and a few hours of CPU time.As we are also very busy there will no doubt be delays on both sides as we work on this together.Please set expectations as you would in your job!

## What I built

I was up to this point relatively green when it came to[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). I chose to break my project into two parts; the first would be a scheduled job that would pull from the [Firehol](https://github.com/firehol/.blocklist-ipsets) list and update DynamoDB as needed. The second part would be a Lambda that is invoked via API Gateway to query the passed input (IP Address) from DynamoDB, and return a JSON payload including information like _IF_ the address was blocked, where it was found as well as some geodata about the IP.

## What I would do differently

While my deployment worked, if I had to do it over again, I would likely move the backend / update from a lambda to an EC2 instance to mitigate potential timeouts.I would update the querying side of the project to take in IP ranges with CIDR e.g`a.b.c.0/24`

Lastly while I used`serverless` in this implementation, if I were to do it over I would concider using`aws-cdk` as my TypeScript library of choice as it is maintained directly from Amazon's AWS team and builds the blueprints/templates for your stack.
