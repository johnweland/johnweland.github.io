It is not uncommon these days to have a potential employer put your skills to the test with a code challenge. Typically, in my experience, this is a smaller task or set of tasks and they expect you do perform live over the course of a few minutes to an hour.

This was the first time I had -- had a code challenge that was not live and where the expected turnaround was approximately a week of development time.

## The Project Description

> &nbsp;
> The goal of this exercise is to iterate on the development and deployment of a “cloud native” service in AWS that can be invoked to check a set of IP address lists for every single attempted phone call placed on our network, as part of a larger fraud detection system.If the IP address is listed in any sources, then they should be returned.
>
> The service will retrieve and automatically update from https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets without any manual intervention.
> &nbsp;

- Deliverables should include everything needed to deploy(and maintain) the service in a production AWS account.
- Code should be developed in Typescript or Java, and only make the assumption all developers run a macOS development environment.
- Bonus points for high availability deployments, benchmarks, and telemetry.

## What I built

I was up to this point relatively green when it came to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). I chose to break my project into two parts; the first was a scheduled job that would run on Lambda to pull from the [Firehol](https://github.com/firehol/.blocklist-ipsets) list and update DynamoDB as needed.

The second part was a Lambda that was invoked via API Gateway to query the passed input (IP Address)from DynamoDB. Then return a JSON payload including information like "is the IP on a block list"? "Where is the IP from geographically"?

## What I would do differently

While my deployment worked, if I had to do it over again; I could keep a queryable service with something like this.

1. I would move the setup/update to an EC2 instance that would be started and stopped by a lambda.

   - This would weed out any potential timeouts trying ot update the IP addresses directly from Lambda which as a 15 minute max time limit.
   - If there was an error in updating, this would allow me to set an alarm and then trigger a second attempt or get a human involved.

2. I would update the querying side of the project to take in IP ranges with CIDR e.g `a.b.c.0/24`

3. Lastly while I used `serverless` in this implementation, if I were to do it over I would concider using `aws-cdk` as my TypeScript library of choice as it is maintained directly from Amazon's AWS team and builds the blueprints/templates for your stack.

An alternative if you don't need a queryable service, is that the EC2 that runs to update the IP list rather than updating a DynamoDB you could simply update the WAF (web application firewall) in front of your infrastructurer.
